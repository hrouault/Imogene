Overview
========

**Imogene** works in two different modes. In the *genmot* mode, motifs are
predicted on the basis of a set of functionally related enhancers. In the
*scangen* mode, enhancers are predicted from a set of motifs.

It is programmed in C++, accompanied by a bunch of python help scripts. In
addition, an xml description page is provided for the
[mobyle](mobyle.pasteur.fr) system.

You can refer to the INSTALL file for detailled installation instructions.

required genomes. To help in that task, scripts have been added in the script
folder.  execute
`$(prefix)/lib/python-version/site/packages/generate-droso-align.py` (for
drosophila genomes)

Files will be automatically installed in `$(prefix)/share/imogene`.

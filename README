You can refer to the INSTALL file for installation instruction. 

I advice you not to use the default prefix for installation, which would pollute your /usr/local with imogene specific scripts. I would rather use something like (in the imogene folder) :
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix=$PWD/install

Once the package is installed, the first thing to do is to download the required genomes. To help in that task, scripts have been added in the script folder.
execute $prefix/bin/generate-droso-align.py (for drosophila genomes)
Files will be automatically installed in $prefix/share/imogene


*** Third-party software

This package includes third party software in the folder mobyle. Please refer to the README file in that folder for more details.

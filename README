You can refer to the INSTALL file for installation instruction. In addition, some flags have to be added to support either drosophila genomes or eutherian genomes or both.

I advice you not to use the default prefix for installation, which would pollute your /usr/local with imogene specific scripts. I would rather use something like (in the imogene folder) :
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --enable-droso --prefix=$PWD/imogene

Once the package is installed, the first thing to do is to download the required genomes. To help in that task, scripts have been added in the script folder.
Create then a folder where to stock the alignments :
mkdir align
cd align
../test/bin/generate-droso-alignlist.sh

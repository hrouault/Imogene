@section Extraction

For drosophila, there is a file @file{examples/extract/coords-droso.dat} that can be used as an input for @command{imogene extract}:
@smallexample
imogene extract -s droso --input examples/extract/coords-droso.dat
@end smallexample
It creates a folder @file{align} containing the extracted fasta formatted alignments.

@section Running genmot on the extracted sequences

You now have to run genmot on the extracted alignments

@smallexample
imogene genmot -s droso -a align
@end smallexample

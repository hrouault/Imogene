@node Extract
@chapter Extract an alignment from a coordinate file

@cindex extract, alignment

This is the output of @code{imogene extract --help}:

@smallexample
@include extract.help
@end smallexample

You mainly need to provide a coordinate file in the form of:

@smallexample
enhancer1 2L 2345  3456
enhancer2 2R 4567  5678
@end smallexample

You can find example files in the folder @file{example} of the tarball. You can then try:
@smallexample
imogene extract --input example/enhancer-coords.dat
@end smallexample

@node Extract
@chapter Extract an alignment from a coordinate file

@cindex extract, alignment

This is the output of @code{imogene extract --help}:

@smallexample
@c @include extract.help
@end smallexample

You mainly need to provide a coordinate file in the BED4 format:

@smallexample
chr2L 2345  3456 enhancer1 
chr2R 4567  5678 enhancer2
@end smallexample

The coordinates should use the release 5 (or dm3) system for @emph{Drosophila Melanogaster} and the mm9 system for @emph{Mus Musculus}.
You can find example files in the folder @file{example} of the tarball. You can then try:
@smallexample
imogene extract --input example/enhancer-coords.dat
@end smallexample

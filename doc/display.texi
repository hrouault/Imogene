@chapter Displays motifs on sequences

@section Invoking the command line tool

This is the output of @code{imogene display --help}:

@smallexample
@c @include display.help
@end smallexample

You need to provide a motif file as generated by the genmot mode, and the path to the folder containing the fasta (.fa) formatted alignments you wish to scan. 
These alignments can be automatically generated from a coordinate file using the extract mode. 
Depending on the chosen mode, the output will be the tex formatted sequences (@command{tex-ref} and @command{tex-align}), or a svg formatted graphical representation of motifs instances on the sequences (@command{svg}).
You can find example files in the folder @file{example} of the tarball. You can then try:
@smallexample
imogene display -s eutherian -m motifs.txt -a align --tex-ref
imogene display -s eutherian -m motifs.txt -a align --tex-align
imogene display -s eutherian -m motifs.txt -a align --svg
@end smallexample

@section Generating motif logo

This mode uses the @command{python} modules corebio and weblogo. You can install them with:
@smallexample
> pip install corebio
> pip install weblogo
@end smallexample

@chapter Distance between PWMs

@cindex distance, PWM

@section Description of the distance

copy paste from the paper

@section Invoking the command line tool

This is the output of @code{imogene distinfo --help}:

@smallexample
@include distinfo.help
@end smallexample

You mainly need to provide two PWM files in the form of:

@smallexample
enhancer1 2L 2345  3456
enhancer2 2R 4567  5678
@end smallexample

You can find example files in the folder @file{example} of the tarball. You can then try:
@smallexample
imogene distinfo --input example/PWM1.dat example/PWM2.dat
@end smallexample

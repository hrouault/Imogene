@cindex installation

The first step is to invoke the usual commands to install a package (once you have extracted to tarball)@footnote{Note that if you use the development version from github, you have first to generate the configure script using @command{./autogen.sh}}:
@example 
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix="install/full/path"
make
make install
@end example

@section Alignment files download

@subsection Eutherian

@subsection Drosophilae

To download Drosophilae genomes, you have to execute the proper python script~:
@command{python $PREFIX/lib/python-yourversion/site-packages/getalign-droso.py}

@section Background sequences generation

In order to compare the statistics of the sequences taken into account for motif generation, some background sequences need to be selected. Two options are offered to you~:
@enumerate
@item use the set of coordinates provided in the data folder
@item generate a new set of coordinates
@end enumerate

@subsection Generate a new set of coordinates

You have to execute the script @command{python $PREFIX/lib/python-yourversion/site-packages/getalign-droso.py}
